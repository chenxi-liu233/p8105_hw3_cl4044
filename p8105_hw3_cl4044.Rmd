## Problem 1
```{r}
data("instacart")
```
This dataset contains `r nrow(instacart)` rows and `r ncol(instacart)` columns. 

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user / order variables -- user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There are also item variables -- name, aisle, department, and some numeric codes. 

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

There are  `r nlevels(pull(instacart,aisle))` aisles. Fresh Vegetables are the most items from.
```{r}
instacart %>% 
	count(aisle) %>% 
	filter(n > 10000) %>% 
	mutate(
		aisle = factor(aisle),
		aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
	) %>% 
	ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
	geom_point() + 
	theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```


Let's make a table!!

```{r}
instacart %>% 
	filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
	group_by(aisle) %>% 
	count(product_name) %>% 
	mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
	filter(rank < 4) %>% 
	arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
	knitr::kable()
```


Apples vs ice cream..

```{r}
instacart %>% 
	filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
	group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
	summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
	pivot_wider(
		names_from = order_dow,
		values_from = mean_hour
	)
```

## Problem 2

Load, tidy, and wrangle the data.
```{r}
accel_df = read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("activity"), 
               names_to = "minute", 
               names_prefix = "activity_", 
               values_to = "activity_count"
               ) %>%
  mutate(weekend = if_else(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  mutate(day = as.factor(day),
         minute = as.numeric(minute),
         week = as.integer(week),
         day_id = as.integer(day_id)
         )
accel_df
  
```

This dataset has `r nrow(accel_df)` observations. The dataset contains 6 variables:

`week`: the week of the obeservation, a integer variable ranging from  `r min(accel_df$week)`- `r max(accel_df$week)`. 

`day_id`: the unique id of the day of the observation, a integer varible ranging from `r min(accel_df$day_id)` to `r max(accel_df$day_id)`

`day`: the name of the day of the week, a factor variable from Monday to Sunday.

`activity_count`: per-minute activity counts, a double variable ranging from `r min(accel_df$activity_count)` to `r max(accel_df$activity_count)`. 

`weekend`: a logical variable indicates whether the day is a day of observation is a weekend.

create a table showing the aggregation accross minutes to create a total activity variable for each day
```{r}
table_df =
  accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(day_activity_sum = sum(activity_count)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
      id_cols = "week",
      names_from = "day",
      values_from = "day_activity_sum"
    ) %>%
  select(week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Aggregated activity counts by day and week")
table_df
```

The weekday activities counts are fairly consistant throughout the week. From week 1 to week 3, the activity counts on weekends are slightly lower than that of on weekdays. However, form week 4 to week 5, the activity counts on weekends are much lower than that of on weekdays. 

```{r, fig.width=9,fig.height=18}
accel_df %>%
  group_by(day, minute) %>% 
  summarize(activity_sum = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute ,y = activity_sum, color = day)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .2, size = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(size = 0.8) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    title = "24-hour Activity Time Courses Across Each Day",
    x = "Hours",
    y = "Activity Counts",
    caption = "Accelerometer data collected on a 63 year-old male with BMI 25",
    color = "Day of the week") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(seq(0, 1440, by = 60)),
    labels = c(seq(0, 24, by = 1))
  )
```

From the graph above, I observed that this person usually sleep from 23PM to 5AM everyday because the activity counts during these hours are relatively low.
